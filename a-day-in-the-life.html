<h3>1. Pre Sales:</h3>
<p>Potential Customer: “I’m considering switching to Product Customizer. Does your app allow live image previews?”
Me: "I'm sorry, we actually do not currently offer that feature, but we are always developing new features for our app. Let me tell you about some of the other features we currently offer."</p>
<h3>2. Fire Alarm:</h3>
<p>In this situation, I would identify the problem and then send out an email in response to the customers know that the problem would be resolved as quickly as possible and stating that i was sorry for any inconenience.
I would then begin working to resolve the problem and notify them when in was fixed. </p>
<h3> 3. Step-by-Step:</h3>
<p>The steps I took to purchase concert tickets...</p>
<h4> Step One </h4>
<li>Research. The first thing I did was verify dates, times, and venues.</li>
<h4> Step Two </h4>
<li>Compare. I then compared prices between ticket sales and distribution companies to assure I got the best value.</li>
<h4> Step Three </h4>
<li> Select & Purchase. Finally, after hours of price comparisons I found the tickets, clicked the purchase link, entered my personal info, credit info, etc., and completed my purchase.</li>
