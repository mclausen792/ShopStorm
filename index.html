      <h3> About Me </h3>
      <p> Who am I, you ask. I am a 24 year old Produce Manager that recently took an interest in coding and web development. I have worked for the Kroger company for the past six years in a direct customer service role and during
        that time I have learned a lot about customer service. I am interested in your customer support specialist postion because I am looking to broaden my horizons and find a job where I can use my customer service experience as well gain some new experience
      while learning something new.</p>
      <p> I recently took a class called Zero to Web Designer through Galvanize in Boulder, Colorado. During this class I gained a basic knowledge of how to build and design a basic web page. I am eager to learn more so your focus on continued development excited me.</p>
      <p> I believe I could be successful as a cusstomer support specialist, because I am a self-motivated, driven, and dedicated indiviual so I believe I could thrive in a remote work environment.
      I have excellent customer service skills from working in a direct customer service business for the past six years and I am solution oriented. </p>

        <h3> Customers </h3>
        <h4> NO.</h2>
        <p> King Soopers has a "just say yes" policy, so thinking of a situation where I had to tell a customer no was a bit of a challenge.
    We do frequently have customers that are moving ask for us to save them boxes from the product. Unfortunately, we are not allowed to ave them for safety and sanitation reasons.
  I always start by apologizing and then explain the reasons why we cannot save them. I always offer that they can check back periodically because we recycle them throughout the day, as well as offer that they can always call before they come over to ask us if we have boxes.
In general this satisfies the customer while still allowing us to follow procedure. </p>
        <h4> Are They Right?</h4>
        <p>Is the customer always right? No. Do we let them believe they are and treat them like they are? Yes.
        I believe that is what good customer service is, letting them feel like they are right. There are of course situations where wrong is wrong, but overall you are there to provide a service and letting them feel right is just a prt of that.
